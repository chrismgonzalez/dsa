# Data Structures and Algorithms with Go

<hr>

The aim of this repository is to provide Gophers with essential knowledge essential data structures and algorithms, and
how they are implemented in the Go programming language. I've started this repository as a notepad for my own personal
learning, but wanted to open source it for others who could benefit.

When possible, all implementations are backed by unit tests to ensure the code functions as we expect. This mainly
applies to the algorithms section, though, if a data structure has methods implemented on it, then it will be backed by
a test.

Referenced are many popular texts written for Java and Python, such as:

- The Algorithm Design Manual - Skiena
- Elements of Programming Interviews - Adnan Aziz, et al.
- Algorithms, 4th Edition - Sedgewick & Wayne
- The Go Programming Language - Donovan & Kernighan
