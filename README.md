# Data Structures and Algorithms with Go

<hr>

The aim of this repository is to provide Gophers with how data structures and algorithms are implemented in the Go
programming language. Implementations include standard library implementations as well as custom implementations (ex:
Building a dynamic array from scratch)

When possible, all implementations are backed by unit tests to ensure correctness of the code. This mainly applies to
the algorithms section, though, if a data structure has methods implented on it, then it will be backed by a test.

Referenced are many popular texts written for Java and Python, such as:

- The Algorithm Design Manual - Skiena
- Elements of Programming Interviews - Adnan Aziz, et al.
- Algorithms, 4th Edition - Sedgewick & Wayne
- The Go Programming Language - Donovan & Kernighan
