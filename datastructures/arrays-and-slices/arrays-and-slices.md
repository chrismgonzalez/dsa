# Arrays and Slices

## Overview

Arrays and slices in Go are two fundamental data structures of the language. How are they the same? They both consist of
an ordered sequence of elements, you can keep data together that belongs together. Yet, there are significant distances
of which to note about the two structures. If you are approaching this reading from a traditional computer science
background. An array in Go is analogous to the static array data structure, whereas the slice shares its likeness with
the dynamic array. Let's discuss the major areas of importance to understand about both of these fundamental data
structures.
